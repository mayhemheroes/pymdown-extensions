# PyMdown Extensions

## Overview

PyMdown Extensions is a collection of extensions for Python Markdown. They were originally written to make writing
documentation more enjoyable. They cover a wide range of solutions, and while not every extension is needed by all
people, there is usually at least one useful extension for everybody.

## Usage

All extensions are found under the module namespace of `pymdownx`.  Assuming we wanted to specify the use of the
MagicLink extension, we would include it in Python Markdown like so:

```pycon3
>>> import markdown
>>> text = "A link https://google.com"
>>> html = markdown.markdown(text, extensions=['pymdownx.magiclink'])
'<p>A link <a href="https://google.com">https://google.com</a></p>'
```

Check out documentation on each extension to learn more about how to configure and use each one.
